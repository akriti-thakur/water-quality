📌 Overview

This project presents a machine learning framework designed to automate water quality prediction, reducing the need for manual testing and minimizing human error. The system evaluates water quality parameters using advanced preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and multiple ML algorithms to determine the most accurate and time-efficient model.

🔍 Objective

Develop an automated system to predict water quality efficiently.

Reduce traditional laboratory testing time.

Compare multiple machine learning models to identify the best-performing algorithm.

Use PCA and preprocessing techniques to optimize model performance.

🗂️ Dataset

The dataset has been taken from the official Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) portal:

👉 https://cpcb.nic.in/nwmp-data/

It contains monitored water quality parameters from various locations across India under the National Water Monitoring Programme (NWMP).

⚙️ Methodology
✅ 1. Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values

Encoding categorical variables

Scaling numerical features

Removing noise and inconsistencies

✅ 2. Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)

PCA applied to reduce feature space

Maintains maximum variance while minimizing computation

✅ 3. Model Training & Evaluation

Both classification and regression tasks were performed.
